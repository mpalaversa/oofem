Hi. I am a small blind text. For as long as I can remember. It was not easy to understand what it means to be a blind text: it makes no sense. Really no sense. You are inconclusively inserted and turned around - and often not even read. But am I therefore worse text than others? Alright, I'll never be on the bestseller lists. But other texts do not do that either. And that's why it does not bother me to be very blind. And if you still read these lines, then I've done something as a small blind text of what all the right and important texts usually only dream.
