## Getting Started
### What is here
The source directory tree holds source code to the OOFEM package.  
```
  OOFEM_TOP_DIR
  |
  |-- doc - contains the "User's guide", sources to generate "Reference manual", 
  |         documents describing the input file specifications, element and
  |         material libraries, and other useful documents. 
  |
  |-- src - source files of all oofem modules
  |   |
  |   |-- oofemlib - sources of the core part of OOFEM, the OOFEMlib module.
  |   |
  |   |-- sm       - sources of structural analysis module.
  |   |
  |   |-- tm       - sources of transport problem module.
  |   |
  |   |-- fm       - sources of fluid mechanics module.
  |   |
  |   |-- dss      - includes the sources for Direct Sparse Solver (DSS),
  |   |              contributed by R. Vondracek)
  |   |
  |   |-- main     - contains the sources of main() and implementation of some 
  |                  global functions for oofem, oofeg.
  |
  |-- tools   - sources for several utility programs.
  |
  |-- tests   - contains several tests, which are useful to verify
  |             the program functionality.
  |
  |-- bindings - holds sources to generate OOFEM bindings to Python programming language.
```


### Pre-requisites

* The oofem requires the CMake cross-platform build system and C++ compiler with STL support (Standard Template Library).

* The oofem contains interface to IML++ library. It is the C++ templated library of modern iterative methods for solving both symmetric and 
non-symmetric linear systems of equations, written by Roldan Pozo. It can be downloaded from http://math.nist.gov/iml++/. 

* The graphical post-processor (oofeg) requires the ELIXIR and Ckit libraries by Petr Krysl (http://www.multires.caltech.edu/~pkrysl/), to be installed. 
They provide X-windows graphics support. The version of Elixir to be used with OOFEM is likely to be not compatible 
with the original version maintained by the Petr Krysl. The compatible Elixir version is available at oofem home page 
(http://ksm.fsv.cvut.cz/oofem/oofem.html). The Ckit library can be obtained at the same location.

* Parallel support for distributed memory requires MPI library to be installed. If you do not have any, we recommend to use Open MPI. 
This is a freely available, high-performance, and portable implementation of MPI (http://www.open-mpi.org/).

* For high performance linear solvers, OOFEM can use [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/), [SuperLU](http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/), MKL [Pardiso](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-developer-reference-fortran-intel-mkl-pardiso-parallel-direct-sparse-solver-interface) or [Pardiso-project.org]( http://www.pardiso-project.org/) solvers. 

* For high performance eigenvalue solvers, oofem uses SLEPc. The toolkit can be downloaded from SLEPc project home page 
(http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc). 

* XML parser is supported through tinyXML2 library. The library is required for the CEMHYD3D model and can be downloaded from 
its git repository (https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2)

* The reference manual can be generated automatically from the sources. You can use it to generate documentation of your classes, too.
To do this, you have to install doxygen documentation system (http://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/) and the Graph visualization toolkit 
(http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/)

* To build the element library, material library, and oofem input manuals from the sources the latex and latex2html packages are required.

* The compiled Reference Manual itself is not included in release due to its size. It can be accessed online from oofem home page.


### Installation

Quick instructions for UNIX:
----------------------------
* unpack sources 
* create an out-of-tree build directory
```
   mkdir -p ~/build/debug
```
* configure the target
```
   cd ~/build/debug; cmake PATH_TO_OOFEM_SOURCES
```
   where PATH_TO_OOFEM_SOURCES is the path to OOFEM source directory,
   created in step 0 (~/oofem-2.2, for example). 
* compile OOFEM
```
  make
```

## Running the tests
To run the tests, go to your build directory and run ctest
```
ctest
```


## Additional instructions 
Instead of cmake you can use ccmake which uses an ncurses interface, 
or cmake-gui for a GUI. Use the command make help for a list of all targets. 

You can find detailed installation (including installation on Windows)
 instruction on OOFEM wiki (http://www.oofem.org/wiki/doku.php?id=installation)

To get support check out oofem wiki (www.oofem.org/wiki) and
oofem forum (www.oofem.org/forum) as well.


## Running oofem and oofeg

The oofem program prints out the available options when run without
any option. To run a specific job, you can enter
```
oofem -f input_file_name
```

To run oofeg (graphic post-processor), you need job context file 
(created by oofem, for example using -context option). To run oofeg, enter
```
oofeg -f input_file_name
```
There are few useful oofeg key-bindings:
#### Fast viewing

* B1            =  window
* Ctrl B1       =  pan
* Ctrl B2       =  zoom
* Shift B2      =  fit all (only active drawing window will be affected)
* Ctrl Shift B1 =  rotate
* B3            =  done

#### Selection

* B1            =  select
* Ctrl B1       =  select window
* Shift B1      =  select nearest point (confirm by B1 or select next one by Shift B1)
* B2            =  accept
* B3            =  reject
