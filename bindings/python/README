This directory contains sources to generate OOFEM bindings to Python programming language using Pybind11.
To generate the binding, the pybind11 is required to be installed. Python module pytest is required as well.

#############################
#prerequisites
#############################
pip3 install pybind11

Sometimes it happens that running any example raises an error:
expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before ‘(’ token PYBIND11_MODULE(oofempy, m) {

In such a case, install pybind11 rather from source:
git clone https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git; cd pybind11; pip3 install


#############################
#cmake confuration
#############################
set USE_PYTHON_BINDINGS to ON

#############################
# running the test
#############################
export PYTHONPATH=.
python3 -m pytest /path/to/oofem.git/bindings/python

#############################
# generating documentation
#############################
cd oofem.git/bindings/python2/docs; make html
